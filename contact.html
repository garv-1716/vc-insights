            <p>
                I'm interested in connecting iwth Venture Capitalists, entreprenurs or anyone interested in 
                early stage investing. Whether discussing investment patterns, the data driven side of venture capital
                or just sharing insights into the startup ecosystem, I'd love to hear more about VC! As a student, who is 
                interested in the startup ecosystem and investing side, I find Venture to be the best way to be in the forefront 
                of technological change.

                <p>
                    My interest lies in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and intersection of 
                    technnology and social impact. I have had experience in Vertical SaaS and would love to 
                    broaden my knowledge in other industries and subsectors. I have also taken classes on 
                    venture capital and private equity (FINA 4610) at Northeatern.

                <h4>Why Venture Capital?</h4>
                <p>
                    I believe that my curiosity for VC stemmed in freshman year of college, where I was 
                    eager to work in Startups. After working in a bank for 6 months, I worked at a startup
                    in growth and operations. Thats where I realized VC is what I wanted to do next. I later
                    worked at a Series B fund for 8 months, where I was able to learn more about scaling companies,
                    go to market, and operations. Developing this understanding, from fund structures to exit planning
                    is what interests me about the Venture Capital World.
