            <h3>How Venture Capital Works</h3>
            <p>
                The Venture Capital ecosystem is based on founders being connecting with investors, 
                entrepreneurs and other intermediaries who tend to drive innovation.
                VC firms raise funds from Limited Partners called LPS, which are nothing but college
                endowments, family offcies or even pension funds. It can be a college like Northeastern
                which invests its endowments in the VC. After raising capital from LPs, VCs tend to
                invest the money into portfolio companies, they take on board seats and give guidance on
                growth, which is just beyond financial backing. In general, VC funds tend to operate on a 
                10 year lifecycle, where the first few years are focusing on making the investment, and the
                rest is focused on helping the portfolio companies until they return a multiple of equity invested.
                This can range between 2x - 100x. VCs tend to exit the startup through acquisitions by a corporate
                company, Private equity buying the firm over or even initial public offerings, often called IPOs.
                Another way is selling secondaries, which is selling your stake in a startup to another VC.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                To better understand the VC landscape, we have to look into different types of funds and 
                their investment thesis/philosophoes. Bigger funds like Sequoia Capital or A16Z tend to
                manage billions of dollars and write checks from early stage investments in companies to 
                growth stage rounds, which can pass $100M. Then there are micro-VCs and seed funds which
                tend to invest in very early stage startups, sometimes ideas or startups that just have a 
                proof of concept. At this stage, it is more about believing in the founder's vision.
                Then there is corporate venture capital such as Google Ventures or Inel Capital,
                which tend to offer guidance and want to have potential partnernships to companies in the 
                same industry. These are called CVCs. They tend to provide distribution channels, technical
                expertise and also help the startups capture new markets. Each type of VC is foundational in 
                the VC ecysystem, and powerful founders tend to identify how investors can better align with
                the stage of the company, the industry of operation and future growth trajectory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due diligence: this is How VCs tend to make use of Art and Science. There are analysts,
                associates and principals in every venture capital firm, who tend to source deals,
                work on analyzing the firm and see if its the right fit and with judgement, evaluate 
                factors like market size, growth potential, competitive lanscape, unit economics and 
                technological defensibility. They analyze if the startup is actually addressing a market need,
                if there is a product market fit and the solution is better than existing alternatives. 
                Another point many people tend to miss is if the startup can scale efficiently. Beyond just
                numbers, investors look at founder market fit, the team dynamics and the gap between ideas and 
                action. This helps VCs review 1000s of companies every year but just invest in a small fraction,
                seeing those rare companies with potential to give higher returns which makes the fund work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of venture capital is built on power law: where a small number of investments outperform
                rest of the investments and give the fund majority of its return. In reality, this is How
                VCs tend to think of their portfolio and risk taking abilities. Traditional investors trends
                to want constant and moderate returns for all investments, but Venture Capitalists tend to 
                accept the fact that many investments are going to fail, provide minimal gains but there is One
                rare company that is going to return 100x on the initial investment. This gives VC the courage to
                tap into massive markets and bet on founders with breakthrough innovations, even though the odds of 
                failure is very high.

            <h3>Investment Stages that VCs Invest in</h3>
            <p>
                Venture Capitalists can invest in different stage of the journey of a startup, each has a purpose
                in the company's growth. It varies from early stage, mid stage, growth stage or even late stage. 
                It can also be follow on investments, where a VC invested in multiple stages of the startup raising.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pre-Seed Stage:</strong> This is the earliest stage, where a company is validating
                    its idea and building an initial prototype, often known as minimum viable product. Funding 
                    at this stage generally comes from friends and family, angel investors or even the founder's
                    personal savings. At this stage, investment amounts can vary between 50k -> 250k and companies
                    are often in pre-revenue stage and focused on getting intial traction and product development.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Seed Stage:</strong> This is the stage where startups are trying to attain product market
                    fit, which is nothing but getting validation from consumers that there is a need for the product. 
                    In this stage, the funding is used to hire founding members, refine the product and gain early traction
                    customers. The funding can range between 500k -> 3M. Common investors at Seed Stage tend to include angel
                    investors, seed funds and larger VCs with seed funds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Series A:</strong> This is the stage after product market fit. At Series A, the company Starts
                    showing early metrics, and they tend to raise Series A to optimize the current business model and scale
                    operations. This round is typically between 2M -> 15M, and companies at this stage are meant to show 
                    clear revenue generation, a growing customer base and the unit economics must be viable for investment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Series B:</strong> Series B is an important stage because companies are beginning to scale the 
                    core of their business and this funding stage allows them to tap into new markets, build a larger team
                    and work on go-to-market: sales, marketing, customer success and operations. Investors at this stage
                    expect strong revenue growth, a proven business model and profitiblity in the next 2-3 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Series C and Beyond:</strong> This is classified as growth stage, here is where companies are 
                    tapping into new geographical markets, acquiring competitors or developing new products. These rounds
                    tend to be higher than $50M and include later stage VC firms, private equity firms and corporate investors.
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Growth/Late Stage:</strong> This is the final funding round before companies go public. 
                    Companies tend to work on profitibility, if not already there, and start looking at exit options.
                    Growth Equity firms tend to invest in them and later stage corporate investors also tend to look
                    at these companies as the exit is coming close through an IPO or acquisitions.
