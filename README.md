Styling and Customizations
1.	I made use of custom fonts using google fonts. I made use of Poppins for all the headings on the website and Roboto for all the body text. You can see it on the top of the CSS file as the import.
2.	For the color scheme, for the background I made use of a blue gray gradient. For the header, I used the dark blue gradient, for the navigation I used a dark theme with hover effects which are in light blue color. I also made use of red borders and vertical lines to make the look cleaner near the subheadings, made use of a teal hover for the callout box.
3.	Next, for the margins and padding I made it custom. The main content container has a max width set of 1000px and a padding with 15px radius for the borders. For the card design, which also has shadows, I used for the depth and for a better appearance of the website, making it easier to read. I used custom spacing for the top margin and paragraphs with 1.5rem bottom margin. For the grid layout, which has “Three Things” on the home page, I used a CSS grid with auto fit.
4.	Next for making the navigation cleaner, I used vertical dividers in the navigation pane using border right. I also used the sticky positioning so that it is kept when the user scrolls.
5.	I put the contact information on the footer of all the pages.
6.	I also made use of hover effects for the navigation links.
7.	The images also tend to scale up when hover for better shadow and look on the images
8.	On the cards itself, I used a stronger shadow on hover
9.	There is also a callout box so that the border color changes to teal with the shadow effect for VC = Risk + Opportunity.
10.	There is also the hierarchy as required for the different styles, including h1, h2 and h3 with the borders. This is the for the titles for each section.
11.	For a better view of the images, I made it larger, with rounded corners, the hover scale effect as mentioned earlier and made use of shadow for all the images.
12.	For the footer, I made use of a dark color for the footer, and it has link styling and layout for the contact information on all pages.
13.	One more design change I incorporated was using 770px and 480px so that its properly visible on mobile phones and smaller screens.
