            <h2>Thought Piece on Venture Capital</h2>
            <p>
                Startups has been interesting to a wide range of community since 20th century, and most corporate
                companies were startups before they turned into the big tech companies. How did they get to this 
                stage? Think of <strong>MAANG</strong>, or any of the big tech companies! They all got venture capital funding at 
                the earlier of the stages: from when they were ideas to what they are now! A single investment can
                can help launch the next fascinating tech platform, ecosystem or even life changing medical devices
                in the biomedical fields. It is the <span class="highlight-text">perfect intersection of what we call innovation, impact on society
                and finance</span>. As a CS and Business Major, entrepreneurship and Technology has always fascinated me and 
                Venture Capital lies in the centre of this ecosystem. Understanding startups to invest in, provide a 
                network to founders, support founders and build companies that drive actual economic growth in the
                long term.

                <h3>What draws someone to VC?</h3>
                <p class="big-formula">VC = <span class="risk-text">Risk</span> + <span class="opportunity-text">Opportunity</span></p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Unlike investment approaches that focus on established businesses (Private Equity) or public
                market investments, Venture Capital is at the core of alternative investments. VCs tend to
                get adrenaline from <strong>uncertainty</strong> and back visionary founders who want to challenge the conventional
                mindset. It's all about the <span class="highlight-text">contrarian thinking</span>.
                It's not just about providing capital, it's about giving guidance at each stage of the process, opening
                doors to new networks, sales, marketing, go to market and so much more. VCs are trying to help startups
                become <strong>market makers and leaders</strong>. Through history, Venture Capital has helped companies like Google,
                Apple, Amazon and so many other companies that we use as consumers. It has reshaped how we live and work.

                Through this website, I hope to share the basics of venture capital, the ecosystem and how different
                funding stages can making startups more appealing to investors. Whether it's someone already in the 
                VC world, a founder trying to seek funding, or even a student like me trying to understand the Venture
                Capital landscape, this is a great foundation. VC has evolved very rapidly, and there are specific trends
                all VCs tend to look at: <strong>Artificial intelligence, climate tech, biotechnology, Vertical Software</strong>. These are
                opportunities exciting to both founders and investors as these types of investments lead to substantial returns.

                Venture Capitalists help serve this journey of founders by partnering with them, and it's 
                not just about the money but also mentorship, sometimes tough love to pivot. A startup can 
                be selling to one customer on a specific day and the ideal customer profile can be something
                completely different a day later. It's all about the <span class="highlight-text">judgment, even more than spreadsheets
                and term sheets</span>.
